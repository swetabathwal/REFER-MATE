If you commit this and your `LICENSE` file together, GitHub will automatically detect your license type and display it at the top of your repository.  

Do you want me to **also add a “Development Checklist”** section in the README so it’s easier for you to follow the step-by-step plan until hosting? That way everything is in one place.
